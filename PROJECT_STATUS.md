# IBD Plant Virome Pipeline - Project Status

## Current Status: Foundation Complete ✅

**Date**: 2025-07-03
**Phase**: Week 1 of 2-week sprint

## What's Been Accomplished

### ✅ Repository Structure
- [x] Complete modular directory structure created
- [x] Scripts organized by category (Category 1, 2, 3)
- [x] Separation of working code vs pipeline components

### ✅ Working Code Preservation
**Category 1 - Proven Working (core_analysis/)**:
- [x] `temporal_ecological_fingerprinting.py` - Produced 57 viral families ✅
- [x] `contig_temporal_fingerprinting.py` - Analyzed 11,694 contigs ✅

**Category 2 - Pipeline Scripts (legacy_pipeline/)**:
- [x] `stage1_filtering_preprocessing.py` - Has format conversion bug 🐛
- [x] 4-stage pipeline preserved for reference

**Category 3 - Host Response (core_analysis/host_response/)**:
- [x] `host_response_signatures.py` - Should produce 13 output files ✅

### ✅ Modular Components Created
**Data Pipeline**:
- [x] `format_converter.py` - Fixes Stage 1 long→wide conversion issue
- [x] Comprehensive validation with known results
- [x] Handles real UC temporal data structure

**Validation Framework**:
- [x] `result_comparator.py` - Validates against known results
- [x] Checks for 11,694 contigs, 57 viral families
- [x] Validates all 13 host response output files
- [x] Format conversion integrity validation

**Configuration**:
- [x] `pipeline_constants.py` - Centralized constants from HTCF

## Known Working Results (Validation Targets)

### Temporal Analysis ✅ PROVEN
- **11,694 contigs** analyzed successfully
- **57 viral families** identified with temporal patterns
- **Pattern classifications**: emerging (7,681), episodic (3,056), stable_present (670), declining (287)
- **Test dataset**: UC temporal patient data (6-10 samples)

### Host Response Analysis ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- **13 output files** expected from `host_response_signatures.py`
- Non-temporal correlation analysis
- Network plots, heatmaps, correlation matrices

## Immediate Next Steps (Week 1 Completion)

### 🔄 Currently Testing
1. **Format Converter Testing**
   ```bash
   cd IBD_plant_github/scripts
   python test_format_converter.py /path/to/UC_temporal_data.tsv.gz
   ```

2. **Integration with Stage 1**
   - Replace format conversion logic in legacy Stage 1
   - Test on UC temporal data (known to work)
   - Validate identical results

### 🎯 Week 1 Goals
- [ ] Format converter tested on real UC temporal data
- [ ] Stage 1 pipeline fixed and working
- [ ] Validation confirms identical results to working code
- [ ] Ready for Week 2 scaling tests

## Week 2 Plan
1. **Days 6-7**: Integrate format converter into complete pipeline
2. **Days 8-9**: Test on incremental datasets (6 → 10 → 100 samples)  
3. **Day 10**: Documentation and preparation for full-scale deployment

## Success Criteria

### Week 1 Success ✅ (Target: End of Day 5)
- [x] Repository structure complete
- [x] Working code preserved and categorized
- [x] Format converter implemented with validation
- [ ] Format converter tested on real data ⏳
- [ ] Stage 1 pipeline fixed ⏳

### Week 2 Success 🎯 (Target: End of Day 10)  
- [ ] Complete pipeline runs on UC temporal data
- [ ] Validation confirms identical results
- [ ] Ready for scaling to larger datasets
- [ ] Clear documentation for next phase

## Risk Mitigation

**Current Risks**: 
- Format converter might need adjustments for real data edge cases
- Stage 1 integration might reveal additional dependencies

**Mitigation Strategy**:
- Test format converter incrementally (basic → real data → integration)
- Keep original working scripts as fallback
- Validation at every step to catch issues early

## Key Validation Benchmarks

**Must Achieve Identical Results**:
- Temporal analysis: 11,694 contigs processed
- Viral families: 57 families identified  
- Host response: All 13 output files generated
- Data integrity: No reads lost in format conversion

**Test Data**: Always real subsets from IBD cohort, never synthetic

**Next Update**: End of Week 1 (Day 5)
**Contact**: Continue with format converter testing and Stage 1 integration
